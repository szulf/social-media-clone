Frontend in React
    With NextJS
    TailwindCSS
    Some component library or Manual Components(More prone to that)


Backend
    Echo? framework for http
    Goth for auth
    Db hosted on docker
    Goqu as sql builder
    Goose for db migrations
    Godotenv
    Maybe write tests for the first time(TDD maybe)
    Probably a monolith, because it would be easier tbh(
        Login system(Goth might just take the care of everything here, still need to process image upload tho)
        Message system
        Posts system(Dont know if message and image and video posts are the same)
        Maybe some dev/admin role
    )


Three containers for docker(Front, Back, DB)
    But firstly maybe start without docker
    And later on dockerize everything
    But database on docker obviously


Plan shit out
Seems pretty planned out
Plus I got some frontend design in mind
Still need to plan out some git things

Read https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/about-deployments
Its mainly about setting up Github Actions
And I dont think Ill use CI/CD here
Because I dont see much sense in it for a single dev


Should be able to start writing code tomorrow
YUPEEEE

Start with frontend I think
Seems easier
The same way I did with `chat-app`
